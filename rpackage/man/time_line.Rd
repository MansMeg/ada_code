\arguments{
\item{x}{a vector of the same length as the [time_line],
a [polls_data] object, or a [time_range] object.}

\item{time_scale}{The time_scale, [day], [week] or [month].}

\item{...}{Further arguments to methods.}

\item{week_start}{What is week starting day (1 = Monday, Default or 7 = Sunday).}

\item{start_date}{The starting date of the [time_line].}
}
\value{
a [time_line] object. A list with two data
frames, one for a [daily] time_line and one with the
[time_line] for the chosen [time_scale].
Both data.frames consist of a date variable and
a [t] index column.
}
\description{
Construct a timeline to use based on
the [time_scale] of interest.
}
\details{
The timeline is created based on full months and week.
If a [start_date] is supplied, length(x) no of days/weeks/months
units are added, including the day/week/month of [start_date].
Hence, the number of total days of the [time_line] will change,
based on the weekday of [start_date].

If [time_range] is supplied, the [time_line] will include all
days/weeks/months that is included, fully or partial, by the
[time_range].
